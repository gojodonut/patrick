        <h2>WHO IS MARC ANDREI MARCOS?</h2>
        <p>The Marc Andrei Marcos Legal Aid Center bears the name of the late Marc Andrei Marcos. He was a freshman law student at San Beda College of Law who died during the initiation rites of Lex Leonum Fratemitas on July 30, 2012. He is laid to rest in Tarlac City, his provincial hometown.</p>

        <p>Andrei, whose mother died when he was just four years old, is the son of a civil engineer, a grandson of a retired judge, a brother of a lawyer, and a nephew to a lawyer and an accountant. He was raised with the help of his grandparents and aunts while his father worked overseas.</p>
            
        <p>He finished his undergraduate studies in Legal Management at the University of Santo Tomas. He then pursued his law degree at San Beda College of Law. After his death, his family, friends, and the lives he had touched, fought hard to give him the justice he deserved.</p>
            
        <p>In Judge Martonino Marcos vs. Hon. Perla Cabrera-Faller, A.M. No. RTJ-16-2472, January 24, 2017, retired Judge Marcos filed an administrative complaint against Hon. Cabrera-Faller for ignorance of the law, misconduct, violation of the anti-graft and corrupt practices act, and for knowingly rendering an unjust judgment/order when she dismissed the criminal case filed against the fraternity members for the murder of Andrei and the violation of the Anti-Hazing Law.</p>
            
        <p>The Supreme Court En Banc, found Cabrera-Faller guilty of gross ignorance of the law and for violating the rules of the Code of Conduct when she ordered the immediate archiving of Criminal Case No. 11862-13, the recall of the warrant of arrest which she claimed were issued inadvertently and the hasty dismissal of the case displayed her lack of competence and probity, and can only be considered as grave abuse of authority.Marc Andrei Marcos Legal Aid Center was established and named after Andrei for the continued pursuance of justice for the people of Tarlac. That the rightful justice he never received, may be given to those less fortunate.That, those who have less in life, should have more in law.</p>
